# simple_hangman
Simple Hangman game coded in Ruby.

The initial project was from a YouTube video tutorial. 
Additions:
- Track the letters guessed
- Validate the guessed letter is not already guessed
- Display the list of letters to the user if they guess one a second time

Notes:
The project uses recursion. Not sure this is the best way to code it but it seems to work.

Could look at re-writing the project to include one or more of the following:
- Object Oriented Design (Word object)
- Read the word list in from an external file as opposed to hard coding it
- Validate the input? Do we want to only include letters or allow numbers and symbols as well?
